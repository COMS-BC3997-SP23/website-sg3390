## Update Week 4

### Identifying and scraping competitor products 

After meeting with my superviser, we have decided to add two other products from the same company to our analysis. 
These products are manufactured by Turkey's third biggest food processing company [Ulker](https://www.statista.
com/statistics/937245/food-processing-companies-turkey/). However, the products manufactured by Ulker are sold by 
other food distributors- including local shops. So by obtaining data from two other products, we can see if there is 
a difference related to the manufacturer or the product.
