## <span style="color:Violet">Update 5 </span>

I found a sentiment analysis model utilized for [Turkish text](https://github.com/serkanars/turkishsentimentanalysis). Rather than using a pretrained model, I would have to 
train this model on my data and label certain expression as positive and negative. I am now going to go ahead and 
identify expressions that I think is important to consider for sentiment. To make this process easier I have 
produced a frequency diagram.
