## Project Proposal

This project will focus on building a tool that compares the performance of different e-commerce websites. More than ever, people have
been shopping online to get whatever they need delivered to their doorstep without stepping out of their apartments. As shopping online
became the habit for many people, more e-commerce businesses were created to supply for the high demand. The same product can be bought 
from Amazon as well as eBay or Walmart. In that case, which seller should the user prefer? Is there a way to identify the advantages or 
disadvantages of getting the same product from different sellers? 

In an effort to answer these questions, this project will develop a system that compares the performance of the same product across 
different e-commerce sellers. By identifying the differences across platforms, this algorithm will reccomend buyers the best platform
to obtain their product from. Furthermore, it will point out the lacking parts of the seller and will propose the areas where they need
to improve their service. 

To quantify the analysis, the project will utilize a webscraping tool to obtain the comments under a certain product from the website.
After getting the initial data, a topic modeling algorithm (LDA/TF-IDF) will be used to extract specific concerns from the text data. 
These concerns could be related to packaging, delivery time, customer care, etc. 

The last step for this project is going to be building website that showcases the differences between companies on interactive 
visuals that will best represent the analysis. 

Previously, I have developed programs that utilized webscraping in static website. The challenge of this project will be to build 
one for a dynamic website.
